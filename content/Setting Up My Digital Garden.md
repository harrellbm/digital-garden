***The Big Idea***: Notes on the technical set up of this digital garden.

****

- start with setting up quartz first [getting started](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
- then build and preview to make sure everything is working [build and preview](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/build)
- Then set up a completely empty repo and follow the next step.
- then set up repo to sync with [setup github repo](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/setting-up-your-GitHub-repository)
- then set up the hosting with github without any fancy stuff just use the test page [hosting](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/hosting)
- found new plugin to add dates to properties so that I don't need to use dataview or enveloppe
- using [obsidian-enveloppe](https://github.com/Enveloppe/obsidian-enveloppe) for converting dataview to normal markdown
- using [quatrz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) for static site generation
	- Had issues getting npx to work was able to use `node quartz/bootstrap-cli.mjs` followed by the command instead 
	- very easy to just us `-d` option to specify the envelop repo I cloned back down
- have a separate github repo that saves the raw obsidian markdown files. Use obsidian git plugin on comp to sync with it.
- node quartz/bootstrap-cli.mjs build -d H:\Envelopp\Envelopp-Repo\Enveloppe -v --serve
- Todo: write clearer speck of what I have set up
- Todo: figure out actual hosting flow
- Todo: write down all the settings I have used
- Todo: start by uploading my finished essays and linking them and creating definition pages 
- possibly use [utterance](https://utteranc.es/)to enable comments on the garden
