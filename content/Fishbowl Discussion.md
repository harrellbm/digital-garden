***The Big Idea***:  Type of [[Pedagogy]]

* * *

**Place on Continuum**: Teacher Led Discussion

**Method Description**: 
Arrange the classroom space with a core circle of chairs and an outer circle of chairs.  Sit with a few members of the class on the inside and lead discussion with a variety of questions and prompts. Limit the discussion to just the small group in the middle, and allow members of the inner circle to switch places with people on the outside circle as they feel led, or as you lead them.  The focus of this material should probably lean more towards application.

**Additional Considerations**: 
If you have a particularly talkative, active group, this structure enables you to slowly phase yourself out of the discussion and step to the outside as you are comfortable.
