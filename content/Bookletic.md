***The Big Idea***: A personal project to build a package for the typesetting tool Typst that allows for easy formatting of bulletins and booklets.

* * *
## Features 

Fully customizable page numbers. Can define as many layouts for different page ranges. Every layout has a start number and alt start number to display and a style. Each style can define values for all, even or odd pages 

Easily switch between drafting and signature ordering 

TODO: make a nice description of features

## Booklet function
wrapper of sig function that adds convince features like auto break into pages. But only handles a single signature
