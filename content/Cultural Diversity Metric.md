> `Importance`: 10%
 
***The Big Idea***: the idea that a church has a bigger impact or footprint when more cultural groups are involved and a part of the group. This is because two people that go home to vastly different parts of the surrounding community will see and interact with many more distinct people than two people who live in the same neighborhood and go to the same stores, etc.

Therefore you can measure the exponential impact of a church by the number of cultures represented.
