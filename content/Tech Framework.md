Even programming languages each have a unique narrative of what makes them special and what problems they seek to solve 

  The form factor not just the “function” of technology matters to what categories we use to understand the world around us 

Jesus love breaking people’s comfortable categories

Each narrative pictures ideal human existence by solving particular problems 

  

Structural narrative how it actually goes about solving the problem (and other more background motivators)

  

Presenting narrative the way the tech is packaged and presented to users 

  

Question is not what feature does it have but what picture of human thriving does it claim to promote and what picture does it promote
