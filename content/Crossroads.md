***The Big Idea***: Model for Christian community that meets on Wednesday nights. These nights start with a meal and then lead into breakout sessions led by Pastors and members of the congregation. Sessions can included things like frisbee golf, arts and crafts, Bible studies, workout classes, and cooking classes to name a few. All aimed at living life together.
